					<p align="center" style="color:white";>St. James<br>Avenged Sevenfold<br><br>This is the story of a man who conquered life, drink in hand<br>Ship unmanned<br>Marked by genius, channelled good, by some a bit misunderstood<br>They'd been wrong many times before<br><br>Some times our saints are sinners<br>They blur the lines and lead the way<br>Their way<br>Raise hell and a glass in reverence<br>The fearless lives of our great saints - our saints<br><br>Never a stranger to late night snake bite fist fights and empty pints<br>Unrivalled heights, yeah<br>He led with songs, they sing along, created bonds that held so strong<br>Some were right and some were wrong<br><br>Some times our saints are sinners<br>They blur the lines and lead the way<br>Their way<br>Raise hell and a glass in reverence<br>The fearless lives of our great saints - our saints<br><br>It's by the sea and at nights end, that's when the sin and swill begin<br>That's when he had that certain light inside his head<br>For every whisper he would scream for every drought he'd share a drink<br>For every sorrow there's a light from our St. James<br><br>On the sea by the cliff he watches<br>he waits the night to see the day, his way<br>Last call will find us all<br>But there's a light that leads the way, our way<br><br>Some times our saints are sinners<br>They blur the lines and lead the way<br>Their way<br>Raise hell and a glass in reverence<br>The fearless lives of our great saints - our saints<br><br>[ Get Lyrical : http://lyrics.wikia.com/Avenged_Sevenfold:St._James ]</p>
