Four Point Six<br>Archaean horizon<br>The first sunrise<br>On a pristine Gaea<br>Opus perfectum<br>Somewhere there, us sleeping<br><br>&quot;After sleeping through a hundred million centuries<br>we have finally opened our eyes on a sumptuous planet,<br>sparkling with color, bountiful with life.<br>Within decades we must close our eyes again.<br>Isn't it a noble, an enlightened way of spending our brief time<br>in the sun, to work at understanding the universe<br>and how we have come to wake up in it?&quot;<br>                -- Richard Dawkins, Unweaving the Rainbow<br><br>II. Life<br>The cosmic law of gravity<br>Pulled the newborns around a fire<br>A careless, cold infinity in every vast direction<br>Lonely farer in the Goldilocks zone<br>She has a tale to tell<br>From the stellar nursery into a carbon feast<br>Enter LUCA<br><br>The tapestry of chemistry<br>There's a writing in the garden<br>Leading us to the mother of all<br><br>We are one<br>We are a universe<br>Forebears of what will be<br>Scions of the Devonian sea<br>Aeons pass<br>Writing the tale of us all<br>A day-to-day new opening<br>For the greatest show on Earth<br><br>Ion channels welcoming the outside world<br>To the stuff of stars<br>Bedding the tree of a biological holy<br>Enter life<br><br>The tapestry of chemistry<br>There's a writing in the garden<br>Leading us to the mother of all<br><br>We are one<br>We are a universe<br>Forebears of what will be<br>Scions of the Devonian sea<br>Aeons pass<br>Writing the tale of us all<br>A day-to-day new opening<br>For the greatest show on Earth<br><br>We are here to care for the garden<br>The wonder of birth<br>Of every form most beautiful<br>Every form most beautiful<br><br>We are one<br>We are a universe<br>Forebears of what will be<br>Scions of the Devonian sea<br>Aeons pass<br>Writing the tale of us all<br>A day-to-day new opening<br>For the greatest show on Earth<br><br>III. The Toolmaker<br>After a billion years<br>The show is still here<br>Not a single one of your fathers died young<br>The handy travelers<br>Out of Africa<br>Little Lucy of the afar<br><br>Gave birth to fantasy<br>To idolatry<br>To self-destructive weaponry<br>Enter the god of gaps<br>Deep within the past<br>Atavistic dread of the hunted<br><br>Enter Ionia, the cradle of thought<br>The architecture of understanding<br>The human lust to feel so exceptional<br>To rule the Earth<br><br>Hunger for shiny rocks<br>For giant mushroom clouds<br>The will to do just as you'd be done by<br>Enter history, the grand finale<br>Enter ratkind<br><br>Man, he took his time in the sun<br>Had a dream to understand<br>A single grain of sand<br>He gave birth to poetry<br>But one day'll cease to be<br>Greet the last light of the library<br><br>Man, he took his time in the sun<br>Had a dream to understand<br>A single grain of sand<br>He gave birth to poetry<br>But one day'll cease to be<br>Greet the last light of the library<br><br>Man, he took his time in the sun<br>Had a dream to understand<br>A single grain of sand<br>He gave birth to poetry<br>But one day'll cease to be<br>Greet the last light of the library<br><br>We were here!<br>We were here!<br>We were here!<br>We were here!<br><br>IV. The Understanding<br>&quot;We are going to die, and that makes us the lucky ones.<br>Most people are never going to die because<br>they are never going to be born.<br>The potential people who could have been<br>here in my place but who will in fact never see<br>the light of day outnumber the sand grains of Sahara.<br>Certainly those unborn ghosts include<br>greater poets than Keats, scientists greater than Newton.<br><br>We know this because the set of possible people<br>allowed by our DNA so massively exceeds the set<br>of actual people. In the teeth of these stupefying odds<br>it is you and I, in our ordinariness, that are here.<br>We privileged few, who won the lottery of birth against all odds,<br>how dare we whine at our inevitable return to that prior state<br>from which the vast majority have never stirred?&quot;<br>                -- Richard Dawkins, Unweaving the Rainbow<br><br>V. Sea-Worn Driftwood<br>&quot;There is grandeur in this view of life,<br>with its several powers, having been<br>originally breathed into a few forms or into one;<br>and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on<br>according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple<br>a beginning endless forms most beautiful<br>and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.&quot;<br>                --  Charles Darwin, On the Origin of Species<br><br>[ Get Lyrical : http://lyrics.wikia.com/Nightwish:The_Greatest_Show_On_Earth ]</p>
