Relived my past. <br>And witnessed the beauty of the beast&quot; <br><br>Where have all the feelings gone? <br>Why has all the laughter ceased? <br><br>Why am I loved only when I'm gone? <br>Gone back in time to bless the child <br><br>How can I ever feel again? <br>Given the chance would I return? <br><br>Why am I loved only when I'm gone? <br>Gone back in time to bless the child <br>Think of me long enough to make a memory <br>Come bless the child one more time <br><br>I've never felt so alone in my life <br>As I drank from a cup which was counting my time <br>There's a poison drop in this cup of Man <br>To drink it is to follow the left hand path <br><br>Why am I loved only when I'm gone? <br>Gone back in time to bless the child <br>Think of me long enough to make a memory <br>Come bless the child one more time <br>Think of me long enough to make a memory <br>Come bless the child one more time <br><br>&quot;Where have all the feelings gone? <br>Why is the deadliest sin - to love as I loved you? <br>Now unblessed, homesick in time, <br>soon to be freed from care, from human pain. <br>My tale is the most bitter truth: <br>Time pays us but with earth &amp; dust, and a dark, silent grave. <br>Remember, my child: Without innocence the cross is only iron, <br>hope is only an illusion &amp; Ocean Soul's nothing but a name... <br><br>The Child bless thee &amp; keep thee forever&quot;<br><br>[ Get Lyrical : http://lyrics.wikia.com/Nightwish:Bless_The_Child ]</p>
