All That Great Heart Lying Still<br><br>The nightingale is still locked in the cage<br>The deep breath I took still poisons my lungs<br>An old oak sheltering me from the blue<br>Sun bathing on its dead frozen leaves<br><br>A catnap in the ghost town of my heart<br>She dreams of storytime and the river ghosts<br>Of mermaids, of Whitman's and the Ride<br>Raving harlequins, gigantic toys<br><br>A song of me a song in need<br>Of a courageous symphony<br>A verse of me a verse in need<br>Of a pure heart singing me to peace<br><br>All that great heart lying still and slowly dying<br>All that great heart lying still on an angelwing<br><br>All that great heart lying still<br>In silent suffering<br>Smiling like a clown until the show has come to an end<br>What is left for encore<br>Is the same old Dead Boy's song<br>Sung in silence<br><br>All that great heart lying still and slowly dying<br>All that great heart lying still on an angelwing<br><br>A midnight flight into Covington Woods<br>A princess and a panther by my side<br>These are Territories I live for<br>I'd still give my everything to love you more<br><br>A song of me a song in need<br>Of a courageous symphony<br>A verse of me a verse in need<br>Of a pure heart singing me to peace<br><br>All that great heart lying still and slowly dying<br>All that great heart lying still on an angelwing<br><br>All that great heart lying still<br>In silent suffering<br>Smiling like a clown until the show has come to an end<br>What is left for encore<br>Is the same old Dead Boy's song<br>Sung in silence<br><br>All that great heart lying still and slowly dying<br>All that great heart lying still on an angelwing<br><br>III. Piano Black<br><br>A silent symphony<br>A hollow opus #1,2,3<br><br>Sometimes the sky is piano black<br>Piano black over cleansing waters<br><br>Resting pipes, verse of bore<br>Rusting keys without a door<br><br>Sometimes the within is piano black<br>Piano black over cleansing waters<br><br>All that great heart lying still and slowly dying<br>All that great heart lying still on an angelwing<br><br>IV. Love<br><br>I see a slow, simple youngster by a busy street,<br>with a begging bowl in his shaking hand.<br>Trying to smile but hurting infinitely. Nobody notices.<br>I do, but walk by.<br><br>An old man gets naked and kisses a model-doll in his attic.<br>It's half-light and he's in tears.<br>When he finally comes his eyes are cascading.<br><br>I see a beaten dog in a pungent alley. He tries to bite me.<br>All pride has left his wild drooling eyes.<br>I wish I had my leg to spare.<br><br>A mother visits her son, smiles to him through the bars.<br>She's never loved him more.<br><br>An obese girl enters an elevator with me.<br>All dressed up fancy, a green butterfly on her neck.<br>Terribly sweet perfume deafens me.<br>She's going to dinner alone.<br>That makes her even more beautiful.<br><br>I see a model's face on a brick wall.<br>A statue of porcelain perfection beside a violent city kill.<br>A city that worships flesh.<br><br>The first thing I ever heard was a wandering<br>man telling his story<br>It was you, the grass under my bare feet<br>The campfire in the dead of the night<br>The heavenly black of sky and sea<br><br>It was us<br>Roaming the rainy roads, combing the gilded beaches<br>Waking up to a new gallery of wonders every morn<br>bathing in places no one's seen before<br>Shipwrecked on some matt-painted island<br>Clad in nothing but the surf - beauty's finest robe<br><br>Beyond all mortality we are, swinging in the breath of nature<br>In early air of the dawn of life<br>A sight to silence the heavens<br><br>I want to travel where life travels<br>following its permanent lead<br>Where the air tastes like snow music<br>Where grass smells like fresh-born Eden<br>I would pass no man, no stranger, no tragedy or rapture<br>I would bathe in a world of sensation<br>Love, goodness, and simplicity<br>(While violated and imprisoned by technology)<br><br>The thought of my family's graves was the only moment<br>I used to experience true love<br>That love remains infinite<br>as I'll never be the man my father is<br><br>How can you &quot;just be yourself&quot;<br>when you don't know who you are?<br>Stop saying &quot;I know how you feel&quot;<br>How could anyone know how another feels?<br><br>Who am I to judge a priest, beggar,<br>whore, politician, wrongdoer?<br>I am, you are, all of them already<br><br>Dear child, stop working, go play<br>Forget every rule<br>There's no fear in a dream<br><br>&quot;Is there a village inside this snowflake?&quot;<br>- a child asked me<br>&quot;What's the color of our lullaby?&quot;<br><br>I've never been so close to truth as then<br>I touched it's silver lining<br><br>Death is the winner in any war<br>Nothing noble in dying for your religion<br>For your country<br>For ideology, for faith<br>For another man, yes<br><br>Paper is dead without words<br>Ink idle without a poem<br>All the world dead without stories<br>Without love and disarming beauty<br><br>Careless realism costs souls<br><br>Ever seen the Lord smile?<br>All the care for the world made Beautiful a sad man?<br>Why do we still carry a device of torture around our necks?<br>Oh, how rotten your pre-apocalypse is<br>All you bible-black fools living over nightmare ground<br><br>I see all those empty cradles and wonder<br>If man will ever change<br><br>I, too, wish to be a decent manboy but all I am<br>Is smoke and mirrors<br>Still given everything, may I be deserving<br><br>And there forever remains that change from G to Em<br><br>[ Get Lyrical : http://lyrics.wikia.com/Nightwish:Song_Of_Myself ]</p>
