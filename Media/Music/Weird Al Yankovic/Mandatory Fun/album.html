					<p align="center" style="color:white";>Jackson Park Express<br>&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic<br><br>Tuesday morning, 8:15<br>I was riding to work on the Jackson Park Express<br>Seemed like any other day<br>Then my whole world changed, in a way I never could have guessed<br>'Cause she walked in, oh oh oh<br>Took the seat right across the aisle<br>I knew we had a special connection<br>The second I saw her smile<br><br>She smiled as if to say<br>&quot;Hello... haven't seen you on this bus before&quot;<br>I gave her a look that said<br>&quot;Huh... life is funny, you never know what's in store<br>By the way, your hair is beautiful<br>I bet it smells like raisins&quot;<br><br>She looked at me in a way that asked<br>&quot;Did you have a nose job or something?<br>I'm only asking 'cause your nose looks slightly better<br>Than the rest of your face&quot;<br><br>I arched my eyebrow ever-so-slightly, which was my way of asking<br>&quot;Do you want my old Hewlett-Packard printer?<br>It still works, kinda<br>And I've got a bunch of ink cartridges left&quot;<br><br>Then she let out a long sigh, which I took to mean<br>&quot;Uh! Mama!<br>What is that deodorant you're wearing? It's intoxicating<br>Why don't we drive out to the country sometime<br>And collect deer ticks in a Ziploc baggie... aw yeah&quot;<br><br>I gave her a penetrating stare, which could only mean<br>&quot;You are my answer, my answer to everything<br>Which is why I'll probably do very poorly<br>On the written part of my driver's test&quot;<br><br>Oh ho hoo wo, ho ho, ho ho, ho ho yes<br>It all happened on the Jackson Park Express<br>On the Jackson Park Express<br>On the Jackson Park Express<br>On the Jackson Park Express<br>Oh ho, oh wo<br><br>I knew she was startin' to fall for me<br>'Cause she crinkled her nose, which unmistakably meant<br>&quot;Baby, let's wear each other's clothes<br>And speak in a thick German accent<br>And maybe someday we can own and operate<br>Our own mobile pet grooming service&quot;<br><br>I couldn't hold back my feelings<br>I gave her a look that said<br>&quot;I would make any sacrifice for your love<br>Goat, chicken - whatever<br>I could never hold you close enough<br>Let's have our bodies surgically grafted together<br>Aw... surgically grafted together&quot;<br><br>She picked up a newspaper and started reading to herself<br>Which I'm sure was her way of telling me<br>&quot;When you're cold, I will warm you<br>Aw... when you're shivering, I will hold you<br>When you're nauseous, I will give you<br>Pepto Bismol every hour for as long as the symptoms persist<br>Oh, I never, ever wanna see you cry<br>So please let me cauterize your tear ducts with an arc welder&quot;<br><br>Then I glanced down at her shirt for a second<br>In a way that clearly implied<br>&quot;I like your boobs&quot;<br><br>Aw! Oh ho ho, ho ho, ho ho yes<br>It all happened on the Jackson Park Express<br>On the Jackson Park Express<br>On the Jackson Park Express<br>On the Jackson Park Express<br><br>I cleared my throat quietly, and then I looked away<br>And I'm sure it was obvious to her just what I was trying to say<br>I was trying to say<br>&quot;Hey... I'd like to make a wall-sized mural<br>Out of all the dead skin cells that you slough off<br>While you sleep at night<br>Oh ho, I'd like to rip you wide open... aw<br>And French kiss every single one of your internal organs<br>Aw! I'd like to remove all your skin<br>And wear your skin over my own skin<br>But not in a creepy way&quot;<br><br>Then I'm pretty sure she looked at me<br>Out of the corner of her good eye<br>And though she never spoke a word<br>This is exactly what I heard... she was sayin'<br>&quot;Aw! I want to make out with you<br>In an abandoned tollbooth in the middle of a monsoon<br>I want to ride dolphins with you<br>In the moonlight, until the staff at Sea World kicks us out<br>I want you inside me, oh oh<br>Like a tapeworm&quot;<br><br>I pointed to the side of my mouth as a way of indicating<br>&quot;Hey, I think you've got something on the side of your mouth&quot;<br>She licked the corner of her lips as if to say, &quot;Here?&quot;<br>I nodded, implying, &quot;Yeah, you got it&quot;<br><br>And then the bus stopped at 53rd St.<br>And she got up suddenly<br>&quot;Where are you going?&quot; pleaded my eyes<br>&quot;Baby, don't you do this to me&quot;<br>Think of the beautiful children we could have some day<br>We could school 'em at home, raise 'em up the right way<br>And protect them from the evils of the world<br>Like trigonometry and prime numbers<br>Wo no, baby, please don't go&quot;<br><br>She brushed my leg as she left the bus<br>I'm sure that was her way of sayin'<br>&quot;I'm sorry, this just isn't working out<br>You're suffocating me<br>I need some space to find out what life's all about<br>So goodbye forever... my love&quot;<br><br>And deep inside I knew she was right<br>It was time for us both to move on<br><br>No, I never got her number, aw no no<br>She never bothered to leave her address<br>Aw... But as long as I live<br>I'll never forget those precious moments we shared<br>Together on the Jackson Park Express<br>On the Jackson Park Express<br>On the Jackson Park Express<br>On the Jackson Park Express<br>On the Jackson Park Express<br>On the Jackson Park Express<br>On the Jackson Park Express<br>On the Jackson Park Express<br><br>[ Get Lyrical : http://lyrics.wikia.com/%22Weird_Al%22_Yankovic:Jackson_Park_Express ]</p>
