Innocence<br>I remember a time<br>My frail, virgin mind<br>Watched the crimson sunrise<br>Imagined what it might find<br>Life was filled with wonder<br>I felt the warm wind blow<br>I must explore the boundaries<br>Transcend the depth of winter's snow<br>Innocence caressing me<br>I never felt so young before<br>There was so much life in me<br>Still I longed to search for more<br><br>But those days are gone now<br>Changed like a leaf on a tree<br>Blown away forever<br>Into the cool autumn breeze<br>The snow has now fallen<br>And my sun's not so bright<br>I struggle to hold on<br>With the last of my might<br><br>In my den of inequity<br>Viciousness and subtlety<br>Struggle to ease the pain<br>Struggle to find the sane<br>Ignorance surrounding me<br>I've never been so filled with fear<br>All my life's been drained from me<br>The end is drawing near...<br><br><br>III. Carpe Diem<br>&quot;Carpe diem, seize the day&quot;<br>I'll always remember<br>The chill of November<br>The news of the fall<br>The sounds in the hall<br>The clock on the wall ticking away<br>&quot;Seize the Day&quot;<br>I heard him say<br>Life will not always be this way<br>Look around<br>Hear the sounds<br>Cherish your life while you're still around<br><br>&quot;Gather ye rosebuds while ye may, <br>Old Time is still a-flying; <br>And this same flower that smiles today, <br>Tomorrow will be dying.&quot; <br>(Sample is James Waterston from the film &quot;Dead Poet's Society&quot;. From the poem &quot;To The Virgins, To Make Much Of Time&quot; by Robert Herrick.)<br><br>We can learn from the past<br>But those days are gone<br>We can hope for the future<br>But there may not be one<br><br>The words stuck in my mind<br>Alive from what I've learned<br>I have to seize the day<br>To home I returned<br><br>Preparing for her flight<br>I held with all my might<br>Fearing my deepest fright<br>She walked into the night<br>She turned for one last look<br>She looked me in the eye<br>I said, &quot;I love you... Goodbye&quot;<br><br>&quot;It's the most awful thing you'll <br>Ever hear.&quot; <br>&quot;If you're lying to me...&quot; <br>&quot;Oh, you dearly love her.&quot; <br>&quot;... Just have to leave... all our lives.&quot;<br>&quot;Seize the day!&quot;<br>&quot;Something happened.&quot;<br>&quot;Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.&quot;<br>&quot;She was killed.&quot;<br>(Various samples mainly John Voight from the film &quot;Table For Five&quot;, some are from the film &quot;Dead Poet's Society&quot;.)<br><br><br>IV. The Darkest of Winters<br>(Instrumental)<br><br><br>V. Another World<br>So far or so it seems<br>All is lost with nothing fulfilled<br>Off the pages and the TV screen<br>Another world where nothing's true<br>Tripping through the life fantastic<br>Lose a step and never get up<br>Left alone with a cold blank stare<br>I feel like giving up<br>I was blinded by a paradise<br>Utopia high in the sky<br>A dream that only drowned me<br>Deep in sorrow, wondering why<br><br>Oh come let us adore him<br>Abuse and then ignore him<br>No matter what, don't let him be<br>Let's feed upon his misery<br>Then string him up for all the world to see<br><br>I'm sick of all you hypocrites<br>Holding me at bay<br>And I don't need your sympathy<br>To get me through the day<br>Seasons change and so can I<br>Hold on boy, no time to cry<br>Untie these strings, I'm climbing down<br>I won't let them push me away<br><br>Oh come let us adore him<br>Abuse and then ignore him<br>No matter what, don't let him be<br>Let's feed upon his misery<br>Now it's time for them to deal with me<br><br><br>VI. The Inevitable Summer<br>(Instrumental)<br><br><br>VII. The Crimson Sunset<br>I'm much wiser now<br>A lifetime of memories<br>Run through my head<br>They taught me how<br>For better or worse, alive or dead<br>I realize there's no turning back<br>Life goes on the offbeaten track<br><br>I sit down with my son<br>Set to see the crimson sunset<br>(Gather ye rosebuds while ye may)<br>Many years have come and gone<br>I've lived my life, but now must move on<br>(Gather ye rosebuds while ye may)<br>He's my only one<br>Now that my time has come<br>Now that my life is done<br>We look into the sun<br>&quot;Seize the day and don't you cry<br>Now it's time to say goodbye<br>Even though I'll be gone<br>I will live on, live on.&quot;<br><br>[ Get Lyrical : http://lyrics.wikia.com/Dream_Theater:A_Change_Of_Seasons ]</p>
