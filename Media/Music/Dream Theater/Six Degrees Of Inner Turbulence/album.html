					<p align="center" style="color:white";>Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence<br>Dream Theater<br><br>I. Overture<br><br>instrumental<br><br><br>II. About to Crash<br><br>She can't stop pacing<br>She never felt so alive<br>Her thoughts are racing<br>Set on overdrive<br><br>It takes a village<br>This she knows is true<br>They're expecting her<br>And she's got work to do<br><br>He helplessly stands by<br>It's meaningless to try<br>As he rubs his red-rimmed eyes<br>He says I've never seen her get this bad<br><br>Even though she seems so high<br>He knows that she can't fly<br>And when she falls out of the sky<br>He'll be standing by<br><br>She was raised in a small midwestern town<br>By a charming and eccentric loving father<br>She was praised as the perfect teenage girl<br>And everyone thought highly of her<br><br>And she tried everyday<br>With endless drive<br>To make the grade<br>Then one day<br>She woke up to find<br>The perfect girl<br>Had lost her mind<br><br>Once barely taking a break<br>Now she sleeps the days away<br>She helplessly stands by<br>It's meaningless to try<br>And all she wants to do is cry<br>No one ever knew she was so sad<br><br>'Cause even though she gets so high<br>And thinks that she can fly<br>She will fall out of the sky<br>But in the face of misery<br>She found hopefulness<br>Feeling better<br>She had weathered<br>This depression<br><br>Much to her advantage<br>She resumed her frantic pace<br>Boundless power<br>Midnight hour<br>She enjoyed the race<br><br><br>III. War Inside My Head<br><br>Napalm showers<br>Showed the cowards<br>We weren't there to mess around<br><br>Through heat exhaustion<br>And mind distortion<br>A military victory mounted on innocent ground<br><br>Hearing voices from miles away<br>(Saying things never said)<br>Seeing shadows in the light of the day<br>(Waging a war inside my head)<br>War inside my head<br><br>Years and years of<br>Bloodshed and warfare<br>Our mission was only to get in and kill<br><br>A free vacation<br>Of palmtrees and shrapnel<br>Trading innocence for permanent psychotic hell<br><br>Hearing voices from miles away<br>(Saying things never said)<br>Seeing shadows in the light of the day<br>(Waging a war inside my head)<br><br>Feeling strangers staring my way<br>(Reading minds never read)<br>Tasting danger with each word I say<br>(Waging a war inside my head)<br><br><br>IV. The Test That Stumped Them All<br><br>Standing in the darkness<br>Waiting for the light<br>The smell of pure adrenaline<br>Burning in the night<br><br>Random blinding flashes<br>Aiming at the stage<br>Intro tape begins to roll<br>Igniting sonic rage<br><br>Still they keep me between these hollow walls<br>Hoping to find in me<br>The answers to the test that stumped them all<br><br>&quot;The boy is simply crazy<br>Suffering from delusions<br>We honestly think that maybe<br>He might need an institution<br><br>He lives in a world of fiction<br>And really could use some help<br>We have just the place to fix him<br>To save him from himself&quot;<br><br>Curled up in the darkness<br>Searching for the light<br>The smell of stale sweat and shit<br>Steaming through the night<br><br>Random urine testing<br>Pills red, pink and blue<br>Counseling and therapy<br>Providing not a clue<br><br>Still they keep me between these hollow walls<br>Hoping to find in me<br>The answers to the test that stumped them all<br><br>&quot;We can't seem to find the answers<br>He seemed such a clear cut case<br>We cannot just let him leave here<br>And put all this work to waste<br><br>Why don't we try shock treatment<br>It really might do some help<br>We have just the tools to fix him<br>To save him from himself&quot;<br><br><br>V. Goodnight Kiss<br><br>Goodnight kiss in your nightgown<br>Lavender in your bed<br>So innocent as you lie down<br>Sweet dreams that run through your head<br><br>Are you lonely without Mommy's love?<br>I want you to know I'd die for that moment<br>You're just a poor girl<br>Afraid of this cruel world<br>Taken away from it all<br><br>It's been 5 years to the day and<br>My tainted blood's still the same<br>I can't help acting this way and<br>Those bastard doctors are gonna pay<br><br>I'm so lonely without baby's love<br>I want you to know I'd die for one more moment<br>I'm just a poor girl<br>Afraid of this cruel world<br>Taken away from it all<br><br><br>VI. Solitary Shell<br><br>He seemed no different from the rest<br>Just a healthy normal boy<br>His mama always did her best<br>And he was daddy's pride and joy<br><br>He learned to walk and talk on time<br>But never cared much to be held<br>And steadily he would decline<br>Into his solitary shell<br><br>As a boy he was considered somewhat odd<br>Kept to himself most of the time<br>He would daydream in and out of his own world<br>But in every other way he was fine<br><br>He's a Monday morning lunatic<br>Disturbed from time to time<br>Lost within himself<br>In his solitary shell<br><br>Temporary catatonic<br>Madman on occasion<br>When will he break out<br>Of his solitary shell?<br><br>He struggled to get through his day<br>He was helplessly behind<br>He poured himself onto the page<br>Writing for hours at a time<br><br>As a man he was a danger to himself<br>Fearful inside most of the time<br>He was drifting in and out of sanity<br>But in every other way he was fine<br><br>He's a Monday morning lunatic<br>Disturbed from time to time<br>Lost within himself<br>In his solitary shell<br><br>A momentary maniac<br>With casual delusions<br>When will he be let out<br>Of his solitary shell?<br><br><br>VII. About to Crash (Reprise)<br><br>I'm alive again<br>The darkness far behind me<br>I'm invincible<br>Despair will never find me<br><br>I feel strong<br>I've got a new sense of elation<br>Boundless energy<br>Euphoria fixation<br><br>Still it's hard to just get by<br>It seems so meaningless to try<br>When all I want to do is cry<br>Who would ever know I felt so sad?<br><br>Even though I get so high<br>I know that I will never fly<br>And when I fall out of the sky<br>Who'll be standing by?<br><br>Will you be standing by?<br><br><br>VIII. Losing Time/Grand Finale<br><br>She dresses in black every day<br>She keeps her hair simple and plain<br>She never wears makeup<br>But no one would care if she did anyway<br><br>She doesn't recall yesterday<br>Faces seem twisted and strange<br>But she always wakes up<br>Only to find she'd been miles away<br><br>Absence of awareness<br>Losing time<br>A lapse of perception<br>Losing time<br><br>Wanting to escape<br>She had created a way to survive<br>She learned to detach from herself<br>A behavior that kept her alive<br><br>Hope in the face of our human distress<br>Helps us to understand the turbulence deep inside<br>That takes hold of our lives<br>Shame and disgrace over mental unrest<br>Keeps us from saving those we love<br>The grace within our hearts<br>And the sorrow in our souls<br>Deception of fame<br>Vengeance of war<br>Lives torn apart<br>Losing oneself<br>Spiraling down<br>Feeling the walls closing in<br>A journey to find<br>The answers inside<br>Our illusive mind<br><br>[ Get Lyrical : http://lyrics.wikia.com/Dream_Theater:Six_Degrees_Of_Inner_Turbulence ]</p>
