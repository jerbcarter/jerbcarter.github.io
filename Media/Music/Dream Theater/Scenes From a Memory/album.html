Concentrate on your breathing. With each breath you become more relaxed. Imagine a brilliant white light above you, focusing on this light as it flows through your body. Allow yourself to drift off as you fall deeper and deeper into a more relaxed state of mind. Now as I count back from ten to one, you will feel more peaceful, and calm. Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six. You will enter a safe place where nothing can harm you. Five. Four. Three. Two. If at any time you need to come back, all you must do is open your eyes. One.&quot;<br><br> Nicholas: <br>(Present)<br>Safe in the light that surrounds me<br>Free of the fear and the pain<br>My subconscious mind<br>Starts spinning through time<br>To rejoin the past once again<br><br>Nothing seems real<br>I'm starting to feel<br>Lost in the haze of a dream<br><br>And as I draw near<br>The scene becomes clear<br>Like watching my life on a screen<br><br>Hello Victoria so glad to see you<br>My friend<br><br>[ Get Lyrical : http://lyrics.wikia.com/Dream_Theater:Regression ]</p>
