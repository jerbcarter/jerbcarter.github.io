					<p align="center" style="color:white";>Space-Dye Vest<br>Dream Theater<br><br>Falling through pages of Martens on angels<br>Feeling my heart pull west<br>I saw the future dressed as a stranger<br>Love in a space-dye vest<br><br>Love is an act of blood and I'm bleeding<br>A pool in the shape of a heart<br>Beauty projection in the reflection<br>Always the worst way to start<br><br>&quot;But he's the sort who can't know anyone intimately, least of all a woman<br>He doesn't know what a woman is<br>He wants you for a possession, something to look at like a painting or an ivory box<br>Something to own and to display<br>He doesn't want you to be real, or to think or to live<br>He doesn't love you, but I love you<br>I want you to have your own thoughts and ideas and feelings, even when I hold you in my arms<br>It's our last chance... It's our last chance...&quot;<br><br>Now that you're gone I'm trying to take it<br>Learning to swallow the rage<br>Found a new girl I think we can make it<br>As long as she stays on the page<br><br>This is not how I want it to end<br>And I'll never be open again<br><br>&quot;...I was gonna move out...ummm...get,<br>Get a job, get my own place, ummm,<br>But... I go into the mall where I want to work and they tell me, I'm,<br>I was too young...&quot;<br><br>&quot;Some people, gave advice before, about facing the facts, about facing reality<br>And this is, this, without a doubt, is his biggest challenge ever<br>He's going to have to face it<br>You're gonna have to try, he's gonna to have to try and, uh, and, and, and get some help here<br>I mean no one can say they know how he feels.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That, so they say that, in ya know, like, Houston or something<br>You'd say it's a hundred and eighty degrees, but it's a dry heat<br>In Houston they say that?<br>Oh, maybe not. I'm all mixed up<br>Dry until they hit the swimming pool.&quot;<br><br>&quot;...I get up with the sun... Listen<br>You have your own room to sleep in<br>I don't care what you do. I don't care when<br>That door gets locked, that door gets locked at night by nine o'clock<br>If you're not in this house by nine o'clock<br>Then you'd better find some place to sleep<br>Because you're not going to be a bum in this house<br>Supper is ready...&quot;<br><br>There's no one to take my blame<br>If they wanted to<br>There's nothing to keep me sane<br>And it's all the same to you<br>There's nowhere to set my aim<br>So I'm everywhere<br>Never come near me again<br>Do you really think I need you?<br><br>I'll never be open again<br>I could never be open again<br>I'll never be open again<br>I could never be open again<br><br>And I'll smile and I'll learn to pretend<br>And I'll never be open again<br>And I'll have no more dreams to defend<br>And I'll never be open again<br><br>[ Get Lyrical : http://lyrics.wikia.com/Dream_Theater:Space-Dye_Vest ]</p>
