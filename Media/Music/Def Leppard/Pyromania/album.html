					<p align="center" style="color:white";>Billy's Got A Gun<br>Def Leppard<br><br>Billy's got a gun, he's on the run<br>Confusion in his mind, the blind leads the blind<br>Yeah, Billy's got a gun, he's gonna shoot ya down<br>He's got evil in his eyes, got a reason to despise<br>There's danger in the air<br><br>(Can you feel it in the air?)<br>There's danger in the air (Danger)<br>Such a strange emotion<br>(Can you feel it in the air?) Ohh yeah<br>Ohh yeah<br><br>Oh, he was locked inside a room without a door<br>His innocence he suffered for<br>In a world of black and white, they were wrong and he was right<br>Just looking for a clue, it's a nightmare come true<br>He's going underground to track that danger down<br>Oh Billy, hey why you got that gun?<br><br>(Can you feel it in the air?)<br>There's danger in the air (Danger)<br>Such a strange emotion<br>(Can you feel it in the air?) Ohh yeah<br>Oh Billy<br><br>(Never give him an even break<br>Gettin' caught is the chance you take<br>It could be your last mistake)<br>You could be so helpless<br><br>(As a bird with a broken wing<br>Like a sheep in a lion's den<br>Gonna fall but you won't know when)<br>He's gonna get you<br><br>You hear footsteps in the night, see shadows on the wall<br>And the ghostly sound of silence, as the mist begins to fall<br>Then a scream rang out like thunder, but the lightning was too late<br>As the rain came down on the crimson ground<br>It was the hand of fate<br>And a crowd of people gathered round, but Billy couldn't wait<br><br>(Can you feel it in the air?)<br>There's danger in the air (Danger)<br>Such a strange emotion<br>(Can you feel it in the air?) Ohh yeah<br>Yeah, Billy's on the run<br><br>Oh, you better run<br><br>(Never gave him an even break) Better run<br>(Gettin' caught is the chance you take) You better run<br>(It could be your last mistake)<br>Yeah, Billy's got a gun<br><br>(As a bird with a broken wing) Oh Billy<br>(Like a sheep in a lion's den) Oh Billy<br>(Gonna fall but you won't know when) Yeah, Billy's out<br>He's gonna get you<br>Yeah!<br><br>Bang bang<br><br>[ Get Lyrical : http://lyrics.wikia.com/Def_Leppard:Billy%27s_Got_A_Gun ]</p>
