Have gone by! <br>Visions have called back my longing <br>for freedom tonight... Made me sigh!<br>Wasting my life till the day <br>that the voice has appeared... Made me see!<br>I am the one that can make it <br>through times of despair... I am free!<br><br>They built up a symbol of warning <br>to give me fear, <br>to keep me away from paradise <br>although it's so near, <br>expecting I don't take a look <br>at what is behind: Freedom calling... <br><br>Take a look at the open gate! <br>Walk on and don't be afraid! <br>Free your mind in what they call <br>it's the heart of temptation! <br><br>...oh... Go the way! <br><br>Take a look at the open gate! <br>Walk on and don't be afraid! <br>Free your mind in what they call <br>it's the heart of temptation! <br><br>Night after night I remembered the word of the priest:<br>&quot;Thou shalt not! <br>Never give in to the promises made by the beast, <br>so help me god! <br>Never give in to temptation or you'll burn in hell<br>a long, long time! <br>Forever-eternal-salvation is what I can sell<br>if you stay blind!!!&quot; <br><br>But I wanna know what lies behind the gate of their hell. <br>And I wont believe all the stories that they always tell. <br>I got the mind to find out what is right and what's wrong. <br>Freedom calling... <br><br>Take a look at the open gate! <br>Walk on and don't be afraid! <br>Free your mind in what they call <br>It's the heart of temptation! <br><br>Queen of mine I long for you. <br>Tell me why to wait to find our joy! <br>It's your wait for heaven's door, <br>Your fear that makes them grow <br>And let you forget today. <br><br>I'll never go and I'll stay on your side. <br>They'll never know what I give to you <br>is a piece of paradise. <br><br>Heaven can wait! Now I'm living! <br>Heaven can wait forevermore. <br>Heaven can wait! <br>I am to live like I want to also before I'll die. <br>Heaven can wait!

No! <br>&quot;Hallelujah, hallelujah!&quot; <br>Lock up the gates to wisdom <br>Hallelujah, hallelujah... <br>Too late! I've found the kingdom... <br><br>Hallelujah, hallelujah! <br>I see a band of angels. <br>Hallelujah, hallelujah! <br>Freedom calling... <br>Hallelujah, hallelujah! <br>I do not fear the stories. <br>Hallelujah, hallelujah! <br>Freedom calling me... <br><br>Don't you see it? Don't you feel it? <br>Freedom calling...<br><br>Take a look at the open gate! <br>Walk on and don't be afraid! <br>Free your mind in what they call <br>It's the heart of temptation!<br><br>[ Get Lyrical : http://lyrics.wikia.com/Edguy:Theater_Of_Salvation ]</p>
