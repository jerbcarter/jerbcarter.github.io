How we envied you your loves and passions, your dangerous desires.<br>The fires of your emotions gleamed like lost beacons in the darkened depths of the fathomless<br>universe. And eight of you, plucked from Time. Not randomly, you understand. Representatives of<br>your world's turbulent history. We have observed your tribulations from nameless nebulae.<br>The experiment is over. I am weary now. So tired. I too am far from home. Open the gate -<br>complete the circle.
