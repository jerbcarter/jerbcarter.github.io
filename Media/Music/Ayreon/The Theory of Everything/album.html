It isn't in active service anymore, but has been renovated to serve as a private dwelling. High in the tower inside, a young man is slumped on the floor in the corner of the room, apparently in some kind of trance. Someone has put a blanket over him. He is deathly pale, but the steady, almost imperceptible rise and fall of his chest shows that he still clings to life. Standing next to him are a young woman and an older man. Both are obviously shocked and distressed. Their frequent glances toward the door give the impression that they're waiting for someone who is yet to arrive. On the wall next to them is a blackboard covered with impenetrable mathematical equations. The older man is holding a crumpled piece of paper -- it appears to be a note scribbled in haste by an unsteady hand. <br>What follows here is the story of what happened.<br><br>[Teacher]<br>Will we ever understand<br>This complex genius?<br>This visionary thinker?<br><br>Will we ever get this close again?<br>Uniting the forces<br>Of our universe<br><br>[Girl]<br>Will we ever understand <br>His isolation<br>Or his sense of wonder?<br><br>We will never get this close again<br>It's been too long<br>I think he's gone<br><br>[ Get Lyrical : http://lyrics.wikia.com/Ayreon:Prologue:_The_Blackboard ]</p>

The Mother has always supported her husband's scientific pursuits, but the strain of dealing with their asocial child's special needs has worn her down to the point of desperation.<br><br>[Father]<br>I'm so close to the answer<br>A dazzling symphony of cosmic strings<br>I feel the pulse vibrating, just out of reach<br>The music of space<br><br>One single master equation<br>Unification of the great and small<br>I hear the notes but the arrangements is wrong<br>And I'm starting to doubt, but I can't give up now I'm so near<br><br>[Mother]<br>Can't you see we need you out here<br>And what about our boy?<br>I think he's got something to give<br>What secrets lie beyond these hollow eyes?<br><br>[Father]<br>I'm sorry you feel neglected<br>But it's clear that you don't understand<br>I'm aware and I want to be there<br>I just need some more time, for the answer is blindingly near<br><br>[Mother]<br>Are you trying to drive us away<br>Just when we need you most?<br>You might find he's got something to give<br>What secrets lie beyond these eyes?<br><br>[ Get Lyrical : http://lyrics.wikia.com/Ayreon:The_Theory_Of_Everything_Part_1 ]</p>
