					<p align="center" style="color:white";>Journey To Arcadia<br>Avantasia<br><br>A lonely boy, a handful of dreams<br>Cold wind blows through a heart wired-in<br>Open skies he would explore<br>No there ain't no mastery<br>Of passion and a deep blue love<br><br>Yearn to see far away places<br>One day he'd feel two hearts collide<br>In his eyes tears and desire<br>But he prays and he swears every night<br>One day scales will fall from her eyes<br><br>Just with a dream<br>Just with a dream and with a song<br>On my own I may stumble and fall<br>It don't matter at all when you're blessed with<br>Just what's yet to come, what's yet to come<br><br>Burning feet on the ground<br>Get your head in the clouds<br>You're out to find Arcadia<br>And you know you will stand<br>What you can't comprehend<br>Journey to Arcadia<br><br>The more I've seen I understand<br>That there ain't nothing that I know<br>As I awake on padded ground<br>The final curtain of the show<br><br>When dogs run barking<br>And I don't hear no sound<br>And the sky is as blue<br>As eyes have never seen it<br>Then I remember<br>What I'd have been dying for<br>Faith rescue my dream<br>From a role that I've been put in<br>On their screen<br><br>Your eyes, and as I'll look into your eyes<br>We're at the crack of dawn<br>Life will stop telling lies<br>And destiny will know<br>It's just you and I<br><br>Burning feet on the ground<br>Got my head in the clouds<br>Journey to Arcadia<br>And I know I will stand<br>What I can't comprehend<br>Journey to Arcadia<br><br>The more we see we understand<br>That there's a lot that we don't know<br>As you awake on padded ground<br>The final curtain of the show<br><br>Far from eye but close to heart<br>No matter how we try<br>Can't repel the counterpart<br>Our common bond we can't defy<br><br>Oh, wishing on an angel<br><br>I've seen them standing at the crossroads<br>When they were waiting for a sign<br>And they unlearned to face the silence<br>As they unlearned to turn inside<br><br>You're turning to the sky<br>And you're dying for an angel<br>If you want it bad enough, see those eyes<br>That's where two glances collide<br><br>Learn to breathe, learn to crawl<br>Learn to stand, walk and fall<br>Learn to lose and to love, to believe, rise above<br>Love is more than to love<br><br>Burning feet on the ground<br>Got your head in the clouds<br>You're out to find Arcadia<br>And you know you will stand<br>What you can't comprehend<br>Journey to Arcadia<br><br>The move I've seen I understand<br>That there ain't nothing that I know now<br>As I awake on padded ground<br>The final curtain of the show<br><br>[ Get Lyrical : http://lyrics.wikia.com/Avantasia:Journey_To_Arcadia ]</p>
