					<p align="center" style="color:white";>Cygnus X-1 Book II: Hemispheres<br>Rush<br><br>I. Prelude<br><br>When our weary world was young<br>The struggle of the ancients first began<br>The gods of Love and Reason<br>Sought alone to rule the fate of Man<br><br>They battled through the ages<br>But still neither force would yield<br>The people were divided<br>Every soul a battlefield<br>Every soul a battlefield<br><br>II. Apollo: Bringer of Wisdom<br><br>&quot;I bring truth and understanding<br>I bring wit and wisdom fair<br>Precious gifts beyond compare<br>We can build a world of wonder<br>I can make you all aware<br>I will find you food and shelter<br>Show you fire to keep you warm<br>Through the endless winter storm<br>You can live in grace and comfort<br>In the world that you transform.&quot;<br><br>The people were delighted<br>Coming forth to claim their prize<br>They ran to build their cities<br>And converse among the wise<br>But one day the streets fell silent<br>Yet they knew not what was wrong<br>The urge to build these fine things<br>Seemed not to be so strong<br>The wise men were consulted<br>And the Bridge of Death was crossed<br>In quest of Dionysus<br>To find out what they had lost<br><br>III. Dionysus: Bringer of Love<br><br>&quot;I bring love to give you solace<br>In the darkness of the night<br>In the Heart's eternal light<br>You need only trust your feelings;<br>Only love can steer you right<br>I bring laughter, I bring music<br>I bring joy and I bring tears<br>I will soothe your primal fears<br>Throw off those chains of reason<br>And your prison disappears.&quot;<br><br>The cities were abandoned<br>And the forests echoed song<br>They danced and lived as brothers;<br>They knew love could not be wrong<br>Food and wine they had aplenty<br>And they slept beneath the stars<br>The people were contented<br>And the Gods watched from afar<br>But the winter fell upon them<br>And it caught them unprepared<br>Bringing wolves and cold starvation<br>And the hearts of men despaired<br><br>IV. Armageddon: The Battle of Heart and Mind<br><br>The Universe divided<br>As the Heart and Mind collided<br>With the people left unguided<br>For so many troubled years<br>In a cloud of doubts and fears<br>Their world was torn asunder into hollow Hemispheres<br><br>Some fought themselves, some fought each other<br>Most just followed one another<br>Lost and aimless like their brothers<br>For their hearts were so unclear<br>And the truth could not appear<br>Their spirits were divided into blinded Hemispheres<br><br>Some who did not fight<br>Brought tales of old to light<br>My Rocinante' sailed by night<br>On her final flight<br>To the heart of Cygnus' fearsome force<br>We set our course<br>Spiralled through that timeless space<br>To this immortal place<br><br>V. Cygnus: Bringer of Balance<br><br>I have memory and awareness<br>But I have no shape or form<br>As a disembodied spirit<br>I am dead and yet unborn<br>I have passed into Olympus<br>As was told in tales of old<br>To the city of Immortals<br>Marble white and purest gold<br><br>I see the gods in battle rage on high<br>Thunderbolts across the sky<br>I cannot move, I cannot hide<br>I feel a silent scream begin inside<br><br>Then all at once the chaos ceased<br>A stillness fell, a sudden peace<br>The warriors felt my silent cry<br>And stayed their struggle, mystified<br><br>Apollo was astonished;<br>Dionysus thought me mad<br>But they heard my story further<br>And they wondered, and were sad<br><br>Looking down from Olympus<br>On a world of doubt and fear<br>Its surface splintered<br>Into sorry Hemispheres<br><br>They sat a while in silence<br>Then they turned at last to me<br>&quot;We will call you Cygnus<br>The god of Balance you shall be.&quot;<br><br>VI. The Sphere: A Kind of Dream<br><br>We can walk our road together<br>If our goals are all the same<br>We can run alone and free<br>If we pursue a different aim<br>Let the truth of love be lighted<br>Let the love of truth shine clear<br>Sensibility, armed with sense and liberty<br>With the Heart and Mind united in a single perfect sphere<br><br>[ Get Lyrical : http://lyrics.wikia.com/Rush:Cygnus_X-1_Book_II:_Hemispheres ]</p>
