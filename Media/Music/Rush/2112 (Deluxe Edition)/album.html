					<p align="center" style="color:white";>'I lie awake, staring out at the bleakness of Megadon. City and sky become one, merging<br>into a single plane, a vast sea of unbroken grey. The Twin Moons, just two pale orbs as<br>they trace their way across the steely sky. I used to think I had a pretty good life here,<br>just plugging into my machine for the day, then watching Templevision or reading a Temple<br>Paper in the evening.<br><br>'My friend Jon always said it was nicer here than under the atmospheric domes of the Outer<br>Planets. We have had peace since 2062, when the surviving planets were banded together under<br>the Red Star of the Solar Federation. The less fortunate gave us a few new moons.<br>I believed what I was told. I thought it was a good life, I thought I was happy. Then I found<br>something that changed it all...'<br><br>[I. Overture]<br><br>And the meek shall inherit the earth...<br><br>[II. Temples of Syrinx]<br><br>...'The massive grey walls of the Temples rise from the heart of every Federation city. I<br>have always been awed by them, to think that every single facet of every life is regulated<br>and directed from within! Our books, our music, our work and play are all looked after by<br>the benevolent wisdom of the priests...'<br><br>We've taken care of everything<br>The words you read, the songs you sing<br>The pictures that give pleasure to your eyes<br>It's one for all and all for one<br>We work together, common sons<br>Never need to wonder how or why<br><br>We are the Priests of the Temples of Syrinx<br>Our great computers fill the hallowed halls<br>We are the Priests, of the Temples of Syrinx<br>All the gifts of life are held within our walls<br><br>Look around at this world we've made<br>Equality our stock in trade<br>Come and join the Brotherhood of Man<br>Oh, what a nice, contented world<br>Let the banners be unfurled<br>Hold the Red Star proudly high in hand<br><br>We are the Priests of the Temples of Syrinx<br>Our great computers fill the hallowed halls<br>We are the Priests, of the Temples of Syrinx<br>All the gifts of life are held within our walls<br><br>[III. Discovery]<br><br>'...Behind my beloved waterfall, in the little room that was hidden beneath the cave, I<br>found it. I brushed away the dust of the years, and picked it up, holding it reverently in<br>my hands. I had no idea what it might be, but it was beautiful...'<br><br>'...I learned to lay my fingers across the wires, and to turn the keys to make them sound<br>differently. As I struck the wires with my other hand, I produced my first harmonious sounds<br>and soon my own music! How different it could be from the music of the Temples! I can't wait<br>to tell the priests about it!...'<br><br>What can this strange device be?<br>When I touch it, it gives forth a sound<br>It's got wires that vibrate and give music<br>What can this thing be that I found?<br><br>See how it sings like a sad heart<br>And joyously screams out its pain<br>Sounds that build high like a mountain<br>Or notes that fall gently like rain<br><br>I can't wait to share this new wonder<br>The people will all see its light<br>Let them all make their own music<br>The Priests praise my name on this night<br><br>[IV. Presentation]<br><br>'...In the sudden silence as I finished playing, I looked up to a circle of grim,<br>expressionless faces. Father Brown rose to his feet, and his somnolent voice echoed<br>throughout the silent Temple Hall...'<br><br>'...Instead of the grateful joy that I expected, they were words of quiet rejection!<br>Instead of praise, sullen dismissal. I watched in shock and horror as Father Brown ground<br>my precious instrument to splinters beneath his feet...'<br><br>I know it's most unusual<br>To come before you so<br>But I've found an ancient miracle<br>I thought that you should know<br>Listen to my music<br>And hear what it can do<br>There's something here as strong as life<br>I know that it will reach you<br><br>Yes, we know, it's nothing new<br>It's just a waste of time<br>We have no need for ancient ways<br>The world is doing fine<br>Another toy that helped destroy<br>The elder race of man<br>Forget about your silly whim<br>It doesn't fit the plan<br><br>I can't believe you're saying<br>These things just can't be true<br>Our world could use this beauty<br>Just think what we might do<br>Listen to my music<br>And hear what it can do<br>There's something here as strong as life<br>I know that it will reach you<br><br>Don't annoy us further!<br>We have our work to do<br>Just think about the average<br>What use have they for you?<br>Another toy that helped destroy<br>The elder race of man<br>Forget about your silly whim<br>It doesn't fit the Plan!<br><br>[V. Oracle: The Dream]<br><br>'...I guess it was a dream, but even now it all seems so vivid to me. Clearly yet I see<br>the beckoning hand of the oracle as he stood at the summit of the staircase...'<br><br>'...I see still the incredible beauty of the sculptured cities and the pure spirit of man<br>revealed in the lives and works of this world. I was overwhelmed by both wonder and<br>understanding as I saw a completely different way to life, a way that had been crushed<br>by the Federation long ago. I saw now how meaningless life had become with the loss of<br>all these things...'<br><br>I wandered home through the silent streets<br>And fell into a fitful sleep<br>Escape to realms beyond the night<br>Dream can't you show me the light?<br><br>I stand atop a spiral stair<br>An oracle confronts me there<br>He leads me on light years away<br>Through astral nights, galactic days<br>I see the works of gifted hands<br>That grace this strange and wondrous land<br>I see the hand of man arise<br>With hungry mind and open eyes<br><br>They left the planet long ago<br>The elder race still learn and grow<br>Their power grows with purpose strong<br>To claim the home where they belong<br>Home to tear the Temples down...<br>Home to change!<br><br>[VI. Soliloquy]<br><br>'...I have not left this cave for days now, it has become my last refuge in my total<br>despair. I have only the music of the waterfall to comfort me now. I can no longer live<br>under the control of the Federation, but there is no other place to go. My last hope is<br>that with my death I may pass into the world of my dream, and know peace at last.'<br><br>The sleep is still in my eyes<br>The dream is still in my head<br>I heave a sigh and sadly smile<br>And lie a while in bed<br>I wish that it might come to pass<br>Not fade like all my dreams...<br><br>Just think of what my life might be<br>In a world like I have seen!<br>I don't think I can carry on<br>Carry on this cold and empty life<br><br>My spirits are low in the depths of despair<br>My lifeblood...<br>...Spills over...<br><br>[VII. The Grand Finale]<br><br>Attention all Planets of the Solar Federation<br>Attention all Planets of the Solar Federation<br>Attention all Planets of the Solar Federation<br>We have assumed control<br>We have assumed control<br>We have assumed control</p>
