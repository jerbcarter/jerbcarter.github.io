					<p align="center" style="color:white";>High Water<br>Rush<br><br>When the waters rose in the darkness<br>In the wake of the endless flood<br>It flowed into our memory<br>It flowed into our blood<br><br>When something broke the surface<br>Just to see the starry dome<br>We still feel that relation<br>When the water takes us home<br>In the flying spray of the ocean<br>The water takes you home<br>The water takes you home<br><br>Springing from the weight of the mountains<br>Like the heart of the Earth would burst<br>Flowing out from marble fountains<br>In the dreams of a desert thirst<br><br>Something swam through the jungles<br>Where the mighty rivers roam<br>Something breaks the silence<br>When the water takes you home<br>I hear, hear the wordless voices<br>When the water takes me home<br>When the water takes me home<br><br>Waves that crash on the shoreline<br>Torrents of tropical rain<br>Streaming down beyond our memory<br>Streaming down inside our veins<br><br>When something left the ocean<br>To crawl high above the foam<br>We still feel that elation<br>When the water takes us home<br>In a driving rain of redemption<br>The water takes me home<br>The water takes me home<br>Take me home<br><br>[ Get Lyrical : http://lyrics.wikia.com/Rush:High_Water ]</p>
