Temples of Syrinx<br><br>... the massive grey walls of the temples rise from the Heart of every federation city. I have always been awed by them, to think that every single facet of every life is regulated and directed from within! our books, our music, our work and play are all looked after by the benevolent wisdom of the priests...<br><br>We've taken care of everything, <br>The words you hear and the songs you sing, <br>The pictures that give pleasure to your eyes.<br>It's one for all and all for one,<br>We work together, common sons.<br>Never need to wonder how or why.<br><br>We are the Priests of the Temples of Syrinx,<br>Our great computers fill the hallowed halls.<br>We are the Priests of the Temples of Syrinx,<br>All the gifts of life are held within our walls.<br><br>Look around this world we made,<br>Equality, our stock in trade.<br>Come and join the Brotherhood of Man.<br>Oh, what a nice contented world.<br>Let the banners be unfurled,<br>Hold the Red Star proudly high in hand.<br><br>We are the Priests of the Temples of Syrinx,<br>Our great computers fill our hallowed halls. <br>We are the Priests of the Temples of Syrinx,<br>All the gifts of life are held within our walls. <br><br>III. Discovery<br><br>... behind my beloved waterfall, in the little room that was hidden beneath the cave, I found it. I brushed away the dust of the years, and picked it up, holding it reverently in my hands. I had no idea what it might be, but it was<br>beautiful ...<br>... I learned to lay my fingers across the wires, and to turn the keys to make them sound differently. As I struck the wires with my other hand, I produced my first harmonious sounds, and soon my own music! how different it could be from the music of the temples! I cant wait to tell the priests about it! ...<br><br>What can this strange device be? <br>When I touch it, it gives forth a sound.<br>It's got wires that vibrate and give music. <br>What can this thing be that I found? <br><br>See how it sings like a sad heart,<br>And joyously screams out its pain.<br>Sounds that build high like a mountain,<br>Or notes that fall gently like rain.<br><br>I can't wait to share this new wonder, <br>The people will all see its light.<br>Let them all make their own music, <br>The Priests praise my name on this night. <br><br>IV. Presentation<br><br>... in the sudden silence as I finished playing, I looked up to a circle of grim, expressionless faces. Father Brown rose to his feet, and his somnolent voice echoed throughout the silent temple hall. ...<br>... instead of the grateful joy that I expected, they were words of quiet rejection! Instead of praise, sullen dismissal. I watched in shock and horror as Father Brown ground my precious instrument to splinters beneath his feet...<br><br>I know it's most unusual to come before you so, <br>But I've found an ancient miracle I thought that you should know.<br><br>Listen to my music, and hear what it can do.<br>There's something here as strong as life,<br>I know that it will reach you.<br><br>Yes, we know, it's nothing new, it's just a waste of time.<br>We have no need for ancient ways, the world is doing fine.<br><br>Another toy that helped destroy the elder race of man!<br>Forget about your silly whim, it doesn't fit the plan. <br><br>I can't believe you're saying, these things just can't be true. <br>Our world could use this beauty, just think what we might do.<br><br>Listen to my music, and hear what it can do.<br>There's something here as strong as life, <br>I know that it will reach you. <br><br>Don't annoy us further, we have our work to do.<br>Just think about the average -- what use have they for you? <br><br>Another toy that helped destroy the elder race of man. <br>Forget about your silly whim, it doesn't fit the plan. <br><br>V. Oracle: The Dream<br><br>... I guess it was a dream, but even now it all seems so vivid to me. Clearly yet I see the beckoning hand of the Oracle as he stood at the summit of the staircase ...<br>... I see still the incredible beauty of the sculptured cities and the pure spirit of man revealed in the lives and works of this world. I was overwhelmed by both wonder and understanding as I saw a completely different way to life, a way that had been crushed by the federation long ago. I saw now how meaningless life had become with the loss of all these things ...<br><br>I wandered home though the silent streets,<br>And fell into a fitful sleep.<br>Escape to realms beyond the night,<br>Dream, can't you show me the light? <br><br>I stand atop a spiral stair, <br>An oracle confronts me there. <br>He leads me on light years away <br>Through astral nights, galactic days <br><br>I see the works of gifted hands, <br>That grace this strange and wondrous land.<br>I see the hand of man arise,<br>With hungry mind and open eyes.<br><br>They left the planet long ago,  <br>The elder race still learn and grow. <br>Their power grows with purpose strong, <br>To claim the home where they belong. <br>Home, to tear the Temples down... <br>Home, to change... <br><br>VI. Soliloquy<br><br>... I have not left this cave for days now, it has become my last refuge in my total despair. I have only the music of the waterfall to comfort me now. I can no longer live under the control of the federation, but there is no other place to go. My last hope is that with my death I may pass into the world of my dream, and know peace at last.<br><br>The sleep is still in my eyes,<br>The dream is still in my head.<br>I heave a sigh and sadly smile, <br>And lie a while in bed. <br>I wish that it might come to pass, <br>Not fade like all my dreams.<br><br>Just think of what my life might be, <br>In a world like I have seen.<br>I don't think I can carry on, <br>Carry on this cold and empty life. <br>Oh, no... <br><br>My spirits are low in the depths of despair...<br>My lifeblood spills over...<br><br>VII. Grand Finale<br><br>Attention, all Planets of the Solar Federation...<br>Attention, all Planets of the Solar Federation...<br>Attention, all Planets of the Solar Federation..<br>We have assumed control. <br>We have assumed control. <br>We have assumed control.<br><br>[ Get Lyrical : http://lyrics.wikia.com/Rush:2112 ]</p>

Temples of Syrinx<br><br>... the massive grey walls of the temples rise from the Heart of every federation city. I have always been awed by them, to think that every single facet of every life is regulated and directed from within! our books, our music, our work and play are all looked after by the benevolent wisdom of the priests...<br><br>We've taken care of everything, <br>The words you hear and the songs you sing, <br>The pictures that give pleasure to your eyes.<br>It's one for all and all for one,<br>We work together, common sons.<br>Never need to wonder how or why.<br><br>We are the Priests of the Temples of Syrinx,<br>Our great computers fill the hallowed halls.<br>We are the Priests of the Temples of Syrinx,<br>All the gifts of life are held within our walls.<br><br>Look around this world we made,<br>Equality, our stock in trade.<br>Come and join the Brotherhood of Man.<br>Oh, what a nice contented world.<br>Let the banners be unfurled,<br>Hold the Red Star proudly high in hand.<br><br>We are the Priests of the Temples of Syrinx,<br>Our great computers fill our hallowed halls. <br>We are the Priests of the Temples of Syrinx,<br>All the gifts of life are held within our walls. <br><br>III. Discovery<br><br>... behind my beloved waterfall, in the little room that was hidden beneath the cave, I found it. I brushed away the dust of the years, and picked it up, holding it reverently in my hands. I had no idea what it might be, but it was<br>beautiful ...<br>... I learned to lay my fingers across the wires, and to turn the keys to make them sound differently. As I struck the wires with my other hand, I produced my first harmonious sounds, and soon my own music! how different it could be from the music of the temples! I cant wait to tell the priests about it! ...<br><br>What can this strange device be? <br>When I touch it, it gives forth a sound.<br>It's got wires that vibrate and give music. <br>What can this thing be that I found? <br><br>See how it sings like a sad heart,<br>And joyously screams out its pain.<br>Sounds that build high like a mountain,<br>Or notes that fall gently like rain.<br><br>I can't wait to share this new wonder, <br>The people will all see its light.<br>Let them all make their own music, <br>The Priests praise my name on this night. <br><br>IV. Presentation<br><br>... in the sudden silence as I finished playing, I looked up to a circle of grim, expressionless faces. Father Brown rose to his feet, and his somnolent voice echoed throughout the silent temple hall. ...<br>... instead of the grateful joy that I expected, they were words of quiet rejection! Instead of praise, sullen dismissal. I watched in shock and horror as Father Brown ground my precious instrument to splinters beneath his feet...<br><br>I know it's most unusual to come before you so, <br>But I've found an ancient miracle I thought that you should know.<br><br>Listen to my music, and hear what it can do.<br>There's something here as strong as life,<br>I know that it will reach you.<br><br>Yes, we know, it's nothing new, it's just a waste of time.<br>We have no need for ancient ways, the world is doing fine.<br><br>Another toy that helped destroy the elder race of man!<br>Forget about your silly whim, it doesn't fit the plan. <br><br>I can't believe you're saying, these things just can't be true. <br>Our world could use this beauty, just think what we might do.<br><br>Listen to my music, and hear what it can do.<br>There's something here as strong as life, <br>I know that it will reach you. <br><br>Don't annoy us further, we have our work to do.<br>Just think about the average -- what use have they for you? <br><br>Another toy that helped destroy the elder race of man. <br>Forget about your silly whim, it doesn't fit the plan. <br><br>V. Oracle: The Dream<br><br>... I guess it was a dream, but even now it all seems so vivid to me. Clearly yet I see the beckoning hand of the Oracle as he stood at the summit of the staircase ...<br>... I see still the incredible beauty of the sculptured cities and the pure spirit of man revealed in the lives and works of this world. I was overwhelmed by both wonder and understanding as I saw a completely different way to life, a way that had been crushed by the federation long ago. I saw now how meaningless life had become with the loss of all these things ...<br><br>I wandered home though the silent streets,<br>And fell into a fitful sleep.<br>Escape to realms beyond the night,<br>Dream, can't you show me the light? <br><br>I stand atop a spiral stair, <br>An oracle confronts me there. <br>He leads me on light years away <br>Through astral nights, galactic days <br><br>I see the works of gifted hands, <br>That grace this strange and wondrous land.<br>I see the hand of man arise,<br>With hungry mind and open eyes.<br><br>They left the planet long ago,  <br>The elder race still learn and grow. <br>Their power grows with purpose strong, <br>To claim the home where they belong. <br>Home, to tear the Temples down... <br>Home, to change... <br><br>VI. Soliloquy<br><br>... I have not left this cave for days now, it has become my last refuge in my total despair. I have only the music of the waterfall to comfort me now. I can no longer live under the control of the federation, but there is no other place to go. My last hope is that with my death I may pass into the world of my dream, and know peace at last.<br><br>The sleep is still in my eyes,<br>The dream is still in my head.<br>I heave a sigh and sadly smile, <br>And lie a while in bed. <br>I wish that it might come to pass, <br>Not fade like all my dreams.<br><br>Just think of what my life might be, <br>In a world like I have seen.<br>I don't think I can carry on, <br>Carry on this cold and empty life. <br>Oh, no... <br><br>My spirits are low in the depths of despair...<br>My lifeblood spills over...<br><br>VII. Grand Finale<br><br>Attention, all Planets of the Solar Federation...<br>Attention, all Planets of the Solar Federation...<br>Attention, all Planets of the Solar Federation..<br>We have assumed control. <br>We have assumed control. <br>We have assumed control.<br><br>[ Get Lyrical : http://lyrics.wikia.com/Rush:2112 ]</p>

Prelude<br><br>When our weary world was young<br>The struggle of the ancients first began<br>The gods of Love and Reason<br>Sought alone to rule the fate of Man<br><br>They battled through the ages<br>But still neither force would yield<br>The people were divided<br>Every soul a battlefield<br>Every soul a battlefield<br><br>II. Apollo: Bringer of Wisdom<br><br>&quot;I bring truth and understanding<br>I bring wit and wisdom fair<br>Precious gifts beyond compare<br>We can build a world of wonder<br>I can make you all aware<br>I will find you food and shelter<br>Show you fire to keep you warm<br>Through the endless winter storm<br>You can live in grace and comfort<br>In the world that you transform.&quot;<br><br>The people were delighted<br>Coming forth to claim their prize<br>They ran to build their cities<br>And converse among the wise<br>But one day the streets fell silent<br>Yet they knew not what was wrong<br>The urge to build these fine things<br>Seemed not to be so strong<br>The wise men were consulted<br>And the Bridge of Death was crossed<br>In quest of Dionysus<br>To find out what they had lost<br><br>III. Dionysus: Bringer of Love<br><br>&quot;I bring love to give you solace<br>In the darkness of the night<br>In the Heart's eternal light<br>You need only trust your feelings;<br>Only love can steer you right<br>I bring laughter, I bring music<br>I bring joy and I bring tears<br>I will soothe your primal fears<br>Throw off those chains of reason<br>And your prison disappears.&quot;<br><br>The cities were abandoned<br>And the forests echoed song<br>They danced and lived as brothers;<br>They knew love could not be wrong<br>Food and wine they had aplenty<br>And they slept beneath the stars<br>The people were contented<br>And the Gods watched from afar<br>But the winter fell upon them<br>And it caught them unprepared<br>Bringing wolves and cold starvation<br>And the hearts of men despaired<br><br>IV. Armageddon: The Battle of Heart and Mind<br><br>The Universe divided<br>As the Heart and Mind collided<br>With the people left unguided<br>For so many troubled years<br>In a cloud of doubts and fears<br>Their world was torn asunder into hollow Hemispheres<br><br>Some fought themselves, some fought each other<br>Most just followed one another<br>Lost and aimless like their brothers<br>For their hearts were so unclear<br>And the truth could not appear<br>Their spirits were divided into blinded Hemispheres<br><br>Some who did not fight<br>Brought tales of old to light<br>My Rocinante' sailed by night<br>On her final flight<br>To the heart of Cygnus' fearsome force<br>We set our course<br>Spiralled through that timeless space<br>To this immortal place<br><br>V. Cygnus: Bringer of Balance<br><br>I have memory and awareness<br>But I have no shape or form<br>As a disembodied spirit<br>I am dead and yet unborn<br>I have passed into Olympus<br>As was told in tales of old<br>To the city of Immortals<br>Marble white and purest gold<br><br>I see the gods in battle rage on high<br>Thunderbolts across the sky<br>I cannot move, I cannot hide<br>I feel a silent scream begin inside<br><br>Then all at once the chaos ceased<br>A stillness fell, a sudden peace<br>The warriors felt my silent cry<br>And stayed their struggle, mystified<br><br>Apollo was astonished;<br>Dionysus thought me mad<br>But they heard my story further<br>And they wondered, and were sad<br><br>Looking down from Olympus<br>On a world of doubt and fear<br>Its surface splintered<br>Into sorry Hemispheres<br><br>They sat a while in silence<br>Then they turned at last to me<br>&quot;We will call you Cygnus<br>The god of Balance you shall be.&quot;<br><br>VI. The Sphere: A Kind of Dream<br><br>We can walk our road together<br>If our goals are all the same<br>We can run alone and free<br>If we pursue a different aim<br>Let the truth of love be lighted<br>Let the love of truth shine clear<br>Sensibility, armed with sense and liberty<br>With the Heart and Mind united in a single perfect sphere<br><br>[ Get Lyrical : http://lyrics.wikia.com/Rush:Cygnus_X-1_Book_II:_Hemispheres ]</p>
