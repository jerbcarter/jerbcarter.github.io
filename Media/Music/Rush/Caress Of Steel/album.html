Into the Darkness<br>Spoken:<br>As grey traces of dawn tinge the eastern sky, <br>The three travelers, men of Willowdale,<br>Emerge from the forest shadow. <br>Fording the River Dawn, they turn south, journeying<br>Into the dark and forbidding lands of the Necromancer.<br>Even now the intensity of his dread power can be felt, <br>Weakening the body and saddening the heart.<br>Ultimately they will become empty, mindless spectres; <br>Stripped of will and soul, <br>Only their thirst for freedom <br>Gives them hunger for vengeance...<br><br>Silence shrouds the forest<br>As the birds announce the dawn<br>Three travellers ford the river<br>And southward journey on<br>The road is lined with peril<br>The air is charged with fear<br>The shadow of his nearness<br>Weighs like iron tears<br><br>II. Under the Shadow<br>Spoken:<br>Shreds of black cloud loom in overcast skies. <br>The Necromancer keeps watch with his magic prism eyes. <br>He views all his lands and is already aware <br>Of the three helpless invaders trapped in his lair...<br><br>Brooding in the tower<br>Watching o'er his land<br>Holding ev'ry creature<br>Helplessly they stand<br>Gaze into his prisms<br>Knowing they are near<br>Lead them to the dungeons<br>Spectres numb with fear<br>They bow defeated<br><br>III. Return of the Prince<br>Spoken:<br>Enter the Champion.<br>Prince By-Tor appears to battle for freedom <br>From chains of long years.<br>The spell has been broken; the Dark Lands are bright. <br>The Wraith of the Necromancer soars away in the night.<br><br>Stealthily attacking<br>By-Tor slays his foe<br>The men are free to run now<br>From labyrinths below<br>The Wraith of the Necromancer<br>Shadows through the sky<br>Another land to darken<br>With evil prism eye, whoa<br><br>[ Get Lyrical : http://lyrics.wikia.com/Rush:The_Necromancer ]</p>

No One at the Bridge<br><br>Crying back to consciousness<br>The coldness grips my skin<br>The sky is pitching violently<br>Drawn by shrieking winds<br>Seaspray blurs my vision<br>Waves roll by so fast<br>Save my ship of freedom<br>I'm lashed helpless to the mast<br><br>Remembering when first I held<br>The wheel in my own hands<br>I took the helm so eagerly<br>And sailed for distant lands<br>But now the sea's too heavy<br>And I just, I just don't understand<br>Why must my crew desert me?<br>When I need, I need a guiding hand<br><br>Call out for direction<br>And there's no one there to steer<br>Shout out for salvation<br>But there's no one there to hear<br>Cry out supplication<br>For the maelstrom is near<br>Scream out desperation<br>But no one cares to hear<br><br>IV.

Bacchus Plateau<br><br>Another endless day<br>Silhouettes of grey<br>Another glass of wine<br>Drink with eyes that shine<br>To days without that chill at morning<br>Long nights time out of mind<br><br>Draw another goblet<br>From the cask of '43<br>Crimson misty memory<br>Hazy glimpse of me<br>Give me back my wonder<br>I've something more to give<br>I guess it doesn't matter<br>There's not much more to, not much more to live<br><br>Another foggy dawn<br>The mountain almost gone<br>Another doubtful fear<br>The road is not so clear<br>My soul grows ever weary<br>And the end is ever near<br><br>Draw another goblet<br>From the cask of '43<br>Crimson misty memory<br>Hazy glimpse of me<br>Give me back my wonder<br>I've something more to give<br>I guess it doesn't matter<br>There's not much more to, not much more to live<br><br>VI.
