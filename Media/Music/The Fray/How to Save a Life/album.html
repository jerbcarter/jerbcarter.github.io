I lost a friend<br>Somewhere along in the bitterness<br>And I would have stayed up with you all night<br>Had I known how to save a life<br><br>Let him know that you know best<br>'Cause after all you do know best<br>Try to slip past his defense<br>Without granting innocence<br><br>Lay down a list of what is wrong<br>The things you've told him all along<br>And pray to God he hears you<br>And pray to God he hears you<br><br>Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend<br>Somewhere along in the bitterness<br>And I would have stayed up with you all night<br>Had I known how to save a life<br><br>As he begins to raise his voice<br>You lower yours and grant him one last choice<br>Drive until you lose the road<br>Or brake with the ones you've followed<br><br>He will do one of two things<br>He will admit to everything<br>Or he'll say he's just not the same<br>And you'll begin to wonder why you came<br><br>Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend<br>Somewhere along in the bitterness<br>And I would have stayed up with you all night<br>Had I known how to save a life<br><br>Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend<br>Somewhere along in the bitterness<br>And I would have stayed up with you all night<br>Had I known how to save a life<br><br>How to save a life<br>How to save a life<br><br>Where did I go wrong?
